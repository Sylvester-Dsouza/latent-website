Vulnerability Assessment
1.	Planning and Scoping:
o	Define assets to assess (e.g., servers, endpoints, web applications).
o	Determine scope, including internal/external networks and compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, GDPR).
o	Engage stakeholders to align with business objectives.
2.	Discovery and Scanning:
o	Use automated tools (e.g., Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS) to scan for vulnerabilities like unpatched software, misconfigurations, or weak encryption.
o	Manual techniques may complement scans for complex systems or custom applications.
o	Example: Identifying outdated software versions vulnerable to known exploits (e.g., CVE-listed issues).
3.	Analysis and Prioritization:
o	Evaluate findings based on severity, exploitability, and potential impact (often using CVSS scores).
o	Prioritize vulnerabilities: critical (e.g., remote code execution) vs. low-risk (e.g., minor misconfigurations).
o	Consider business context (e.g., a vulnerability in a customer-facing app may take precedence).
4.	Reporting:
o	Deliver detailed reports with findings, risk ratings, and remediation recommendations.
o	Include executive summaries for non-technical stakeholders and technical details for IT teams.
o	Example: Recommend patching a specific Apache Struts vulnerability to prevent data breaches.
5.	Remediation Support:
o	Provide guidance on fixing vulnerabilities (e.g., applying patches, reconfiguring firewalls).
o	Validate fixes through re-scanning to ensure vulnerabilities are resolved.
Types of Vulnerability Assessments
•	Network-Based: Scans internal/external networks for open ports, weak protocols, or unpatched systems.
•	Host-Based: Focuses on servers, workstations, or endpoints for OS and software vulnerabilities.
•	Application-Based: Targets web apps, APIs, or mobile apps for issues like SQL injection or XSS.
•	Cloud-Based: Assesses cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure) for misconfigurations or insecure APIs.
•	Physical/Insider: Evaluates physical access controls or insider threat risks.

What is Penetration Testing?
•	Definition: A controlled, simulated attack to evaluate the security of IT infrastructure, applications, or human processes by exploiting vulnerabilities.
•	Purpose: To identify exploitable weaknesses, assess their real-world impact, and recommend remediation to prevent actual attacks.
•	Scope: Can include networks, web/mobile applications, cloud environments, IoT devices, or physical/social engineering scenarios.
Penetration Testing
1.	Planning and Scoping:
o	Define goals, target systems, and rules of engagement with the client.
o	Determine test type (e.g., black-box, white-box, gray-box) and compliance needs (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
o	Example: Agreeing to test a web application without disrupting production servers.
2.	Reconnaissance:
o	Gather information about the target (e.g., IP ranges, domain names, employee data) using tools like WHOIS, Shodan, or social engineering.
o	Passive (open-source intelligence) or active (direct scanning) methods are used.
3.	Vulnerability Identification:
o	Use tools (e.g., Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit) and manual techniques to find weaknesses like unpatched software, misconfigurations, or weak credentials.
o	Often builds on findings from a vulnerability assessment.
4.	Exploitation:
o	Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or extract data.
o	Example: Exploiting a SQL injection flaw to access a database or using a weak password to gain admin access.
5.	Post-Exploitation:
o	Assess the impact of a successful exploit (e.g., data accessed, systems compromised).
o	Evaluate lateral movement potential or persistence mechanisms (e.g., backdoors).
6.	Reporting and Remediation:
o	Deliver a detailed report with exploited vulnerabilities, attack paths, impact, and remediation steps.
o	Provide actionable fixes (e.g., patch software, enforce MFA, update firewall rules).
o	Re-test to confirm vulnerabilities are resolved.

What is Cybercrime Investigation?
•	Definition: A systematic process to investigate cyber incidents by collecting evidence, analyzing attack methods, and identifying perpetrators, while ensuring findings are admissible in legal proceedings.
•	Purpose: To mitigate ongoing attacks, recover compromised systems, attribute responsibility, and prevent future incidents.
•	Scope: Covers data breaches, malware/ransomware, fraud, intellectual property theft, and insider threats.
Cybercrime Investigation
1.	Preparation:
o	Establish incident response plans and forensic readiness (e.g., logging, backups).
o	Train teams and maintain tools for rapid response (e.g., forensic kits, chain-of-custody protocols).
2.	Identification and Containment:
o	Detect the incident through monitoring tools (e.g., SIEM, IDS/IPS) or reports of suspicious activity.
o	Contain the attack to limit damage (e.g., isolating affected systems, blocking malicious IPs).
o	Example: Disconnecting a compromised server to prevent ransomware spread.
3.	Evidence Collection:
o	Gather digital evidence (e.g., logs, memory dumps, network traffic) using tools like EnCase, FTK, or Volatility.
o	Preserve evidence integrity with proper chain-of-custody procedures for legal admissibility.
o	Example: Capturing a memory dump to analyze malware behavior.
4.	Analysis and Attribution:
o	Analyze evidence to reconstruct the attack timeline, methods, and entry points.
o	Identify attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK.
o	Attempt attribution (e.g., nation-state, organized crime, or insider) while acknowledging challenges in definitive attribution.
o	Example: Tracing a phishing email to a command-and-control server.
5.	Remediation and Recovery:
o	Remove malicious artifacts (e.g., malware, backdoors) and patch vulnerabilities.
o	Restore systems from clean backups and strengthen defenses (e.g., enabling MFA, updating firewalls).
o	Example: Reimaging infected endpoints and deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
6.	Reporting and Legal Support:
o	Provide detailed reports with findings, impact, and recommendations for stakeholders and law enforcement.
o	Support legal action by preparing court-admissible evidence and expert testimony.
o	Example: Documenting a data breach for GDPR violation reporting.
Types of Cybercrime Investigations
•	Data Breach: Investigates unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., customer records, intellectual property).
•	Ransomware: Analyzes malware to recover data, trace payments (e.g., cryptocurrency), or identify attackers.
•	Phishing/Social Engineering: Traces fraudulent emails or calls to their source and assesses compromised accounts.
•	Insider Threats: Examines internal actors (e.g., employees, contractors) for malicious or negligent actions.
•	Financial Fraud: Investigates cyber-enabled financial crimes like Business Email Compromise (BEC) or wire fraud.
•	DDoS Attacks: Analyzes traffic patterns to mitigate and trace distributed denial-of-service attacks.
